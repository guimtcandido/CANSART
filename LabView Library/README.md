# LABVIEW LIBRARY

IMPORTANT: For ID's over 121 (included 121) the DATA 8 is dedicated to the library.

Once more you can use the Example to check the logic behind, it is preety easy, all files are included you can read and learn or you can just use.

The Example is how you will have to set your project. 

Best way to use:

1ยบ - Create a copy of the Example, and make your application on the EXAMPLE APPLICATION, so you won't need to deal with much configuration, since the example is most of it.

NOTES:

- Make sure the database is similar to the database on the example. LabView needs the DB to be initializers, specifically on ID!
