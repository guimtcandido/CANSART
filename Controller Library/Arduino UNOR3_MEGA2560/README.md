# ARDUINO CANSART

The Example was developed on platform io for arduino uno, you can change for other units.

- 1º Step: Use the example to test and understand how it works!
- 2º Step: Open the Proteus Simulation
- 3º Step: Click on Slave Arduino and import the code on ...\CANSART\Controller Library\Arduino UNOR3_MEGA2560\Examples\CANSART_UNO_SLAVE\.pio\build\uno\firmware.hex
- 4º Step: Click on Slave Arduino and import the code on ...\CANSART\Controller Library\Arduino UNOR3_MEGA2560\Examples\CANSART_UNO_MASTER\.pio\build\uno\firmware.hex
- 5º Step: The code have some variables incrementing on the slave code, and master will update its db in the run time.
- 6º Step: There is a button connected to master that will set some parameter os the slave DB
- 7º Step: Please Read the code and check for the use, very straight forward.
